## Key Contributions as a Gameplay Engineer  
### **Concept Development**  
  - Created a unique gameplay mechanic by giving a monkey a snake as a grappling hook.  
  - Focused on momentum-based traversal to create an engaging and skill-based movement system.  

### **Grappling Hook Mechanics**  
  - Designed and implemented a physics-based grappling hook that attaches to anchor points, allowing for dynamic swinging and momentum control.  
  - Ensured smooth transitions between grappling, releasing, and reattaching to keep gameplay fluid and responsive.  

### **Movement and Interaction**  
  - Developed versatile movement mechanics to blend grappling with running, wall running, and jumping.  
  - Integrated collision detection to ensure interactions with the environment feel natural and immersive.  

### **Level Design**  
  - Built a multi-layered, vertical level to highlight the grappling mechanics, various challenging swings to keep player engagement. 
  - Used modular prefabs for consistent level design and easier iteration during development.  

### **UI and Player Feedback**  
  - Created visual indicators for grapple points, guiding players intuitively toward interactable areas.  
  - Added dynamic camera controls to transition the camera between cutscenes and player controlled interactions.

### **Audio and Aesthetics**  
  - Added a bite sound effects for grappling hook attachment to make the grappling mechanic more immersive.  
  - Designed level with a playful, jungle-themed aesthetic to align with the monkey protagonist.

## Challenges Overcome  

### **Grappling Hook Physics**  
  - **Issue**: Early grappling attempts resulted in jittery movement and unstable attachment points.  
    - **Solution**: Implemented a spring-joint system to simulate natural swinging and dampened oscillations for smoother movement.  

### **Grapple Point Targeting**  
  - **Issue**: Players had difficulty identifying where they could grapple, leading to frustration.  
    - **Solution**: Introduced a targeting reticle that highlights valid grapple points in range.  

### **Level Navigation**  
  - **Issue**: Some sections of the levels felt either too constricted or overly open, breaking the flow of gameplay.  
    - **Solution**: Iterated on level layouts to balance challenge and flow, adding visual cues to guide players naturally.
